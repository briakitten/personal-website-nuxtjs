As mentioned in the title, I used Vue.js to build this website. This is what's called a "single-page application," where it dynamically changes and reacts to the user. More simply though, it's a library for Javascript. Modern web application development tends to use tools like this (such as React.js and Angular), since it is relatively easy to scale and has a lot of tools support.

**Could this have just been done in JQuery?** ...Probably, but I was really eager to get started and felt like Vue.js would be a good start.

What I learned from this is that programming for Vue is a lot more different than anything else I've worked in. There is a lot of things that happen behind the scenes, and if it weren't for reading a lot of documentation and learning resources, I probably wouldn't have been able to get into it as quickly as I have. Before making this website, my knowledge of HTML/CSS was very minimal, and I would have never thought I would go into learning anything front-end.

Programming in Javascript nothing new to me though. I have used similar syntax related languages for years (arguably almost a decade if you count C# and Java). Surprisingly, GameMaker Studio 2's language (GML) made it relatively easy to learn Javascript last year.

Aaaanyway, applying my knowledge here has been very fulfilling! I hope to continue adding stuff here over the years, perhaps with more to add to my portfolio along the way.
