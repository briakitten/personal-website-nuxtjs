First off, you can find the demo for my game over on itch.io [here](https://briakitten.itch.io/heartrift), or over at [heartrift.com](https://heartrift.com). I wanted to make sure the story, characters, and gameplay felt cohesive before releasing!

There isn't much I feel like I need to say here... but I thought that as I update everything, it is good to also give an update here as well. To be completely honest, I have felt a bit lost trying to figure out what to do now. Do I continue to work on my game full-steam-ahead as usual? Do I learn new skills with web development and make sure my website is as polished as it can be? Or do I jump more into VR development like how I have been wanting to since 2016?

All this introspection has caused me to get in my head again, after all these years. I've said this before online, but my mental health has never been that good as far back as I can remember, even as a kid. The only thing that comforted me was imagining worlds, much like the ones I wish to create. A sort of healthy escape, in a way... it's always been like that for me with videogames too, especially with story and world driven games. That hasn't changed for me, even as I've needed to take on new responsibilities as an adult, because I keep coming around to content like that.

If I say any more, I feel like I would be oversharing... so I think this is a good place to leave off for now. I don't know when my next post will be here, but I would like to thank everyone who has supported me this far in life.

Thank you again for everything.
